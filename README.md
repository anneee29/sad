### DApps
Decentralized applications are software applications that run on a blockchain network that offers greater security, transparency, and decentralization. Built on decentralized infrastructure means that they are not controlled by a single entity or organization, but rather by a network of nodes that work together to maintain the blockchain. It is designed to provide users with greater control over their data and assets, as well as increasing security and transparency. They can be used for a wide range of purposes, including financial services, gaming, social networking, and more.


### Cryptocurrency Wallet
Cryptocurrency wallet allows users to interact with the dApp, make transactions, and store their digital assets. The blockchain network that will be used for dApp development is Ethereum.
